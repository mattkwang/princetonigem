            <h1>Welcome to Princeton iGEM!</h1>
            <p>We're a passionate group of engineers studying at Princeton University, looking to make our mark and improve the world with the tools available to us in the field of biotechnology. Our current sights are set on the 2017 competition season, so be sure to follow our progress!</p>
            <p>The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is a synthetic biology competition to design and build genetic machines. Started in 2003, iGEM aims to promote productive and safe bioengineering, and annually brings together thousands of students from hundreds of schools around the world, all working to solve global challenges through synthetic biology. For more information on the iGEM competition, you can visit their website <a href="http://igem.org/Main_Page">here</a>.</p>
            <p>The Princeton iGEM team is relatively new; the last team from Princeton to participate in iGEM competed in 2008. This past year, we came together to form the current team, resolved to revive Princeton's spirit of bioengineering innovation. Since then, we've worked hard to come up with project ideas, discuss them with our incredible faculty, and gather the resources we need.</p>
